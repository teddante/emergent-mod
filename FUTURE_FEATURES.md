# Feature Brainstorming: Emergent Mod

The "Emergent" mod focuses on dynamic, system-driven interactions where the environment and entities react in unpredictable (but logical) ways. Here are several proposed features that align with this philosophy.

## 1. Volatile Items (Item Ecology)
**Concept**: Dropped items react to the environment physically, rather than just burning up.
*   **Mechanic**: 
    *   Dropped **Gunpowder**, **TNT**, or **Fire Charges** explode instantly if they touch fire, lava, or take explosion damage.
    *   Dropped **Slime Blocks** bounce players/mobs if they land on them (item form acting as block?). *Alternative*: Slime items combine into larger slimes? (Maybe too complex).
    *   **Focus**: Explosive reactivity.
*   **Emergent Result**: A creeper dying in a fire might drop gunpowder, which then immediately explodes, furthering the chaos.

## 2. Reforestation / Self-Planting (Environmental Reactivity)
**Concept**: Nature reclaims the world. Items dropped from decaying trees don't just despawn.
*   **Mechanic**: 
    *   **Saplings**, **Seeds**, **Mushrooms**, and **Sweet Berries** dropped on valid soil will automatically plant themselves after a short delay (e.g., 30 seconds).
    *   Requires light level checks (generous ones) and block validation.
*   **Emergent Result**: Deforested areas (or blown up areas) naturally regrow over time without player intervention. Farms can "leak" into the wild.

## 3. Heavy Mob Trampling (Entity Dynamics)
**Concept**: Large creatures shouldn't be stopped by fragile obstacles.
*   **Mechanic**: 
    *   **Ravagers**, **Iron Golems**, and **Warden** destroy specific "weak" blocks when walking through them.
    *   **Weak Blocks**: Crops, Leaves, Glass Panes, Torches, Tall Grass, Flowers.
*   **Emergent Result**: Fighting a Ravager near your greenhouse is a bad idea. Large mobs feel significantly heavier and more dangerous.

## 4. Fragile Structures (Physics/Combat)
**Concept**: The world takes combat damage.
*   **Mechanic**:
    *   Projectiles (Arrows, Tridents) break **Glass** and **Glass Panes** upon impact.
    *   Explosions cause "unstable" blocks (like Sand/Gravel) to cascade/fall in a wider radius than just the blast hole.
*   **Emergent Result**: Windows are liabilities in skeleton shootouts.

## 5. Reactive Creepers (Chain Reactions)
**Concept**: Creepers are walking bombs, they should act like it.
*   **Mechanic**:
    *   If a Creeper takes **Explosion Damage** (from TNT or another Creeper), it doesn't just die; it **ignites** instantly (fuse = 0 or 10 ticks).
*   **Emergent Result**: Chain reactions of creepers are possible in dense groups (dungeons/raids). One explosion can trigger a cluster.

## 6. Weather Effects (Environmental)
**Concept**: Weather impacts basic survival elements.
*   **Mechanic**: 
    *   **Heavy Rain** (Thunderstorms) extinguishes Torches and Campfires that are exposed to the sky.
*   **Emergent Result**: Maintaining light security during a storm becomes a priority.
